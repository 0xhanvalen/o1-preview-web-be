## o1 Preview back end

Bring your own key to a basic UI for chatting with o1 preview / o1

### Local Setup

1. `pnpm i` duh
2. Go to vercel and set up a postgresql db
3. Import the options listed in `.env.example` to your own `.env`
4. Add a PORT to your `.env` and configure that to whatever
5. Add a JWT_SECRET to your `.env` and set it to whatever
6. Add an ENVIRONMENT to your `.env`and set it to "development" (should be "production" in production, duh)
7. Set your `.env` to have a key `URL` and point it to your instance of [this repo](https://github.com/0xhanvalen/o1-preview-web-fe)
8. follow the instructions to set up that repo
9. create account, go to settings and add key, create project, create chat, enjoy being cybernetic and hunchbacked

### Troubleshooting

Good luck
